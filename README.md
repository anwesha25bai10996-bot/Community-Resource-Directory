# Community-Resource-Directory
Sick of lost flyers and cluttered group chats? This little Python script is a tool for collecting local services available and adding those to a searchable database. With dictionaries and search functions, it helps you get resources instantaneously — from food banks to jobs. No more "I saw it somewhere!" Just clean, coded community connections.
